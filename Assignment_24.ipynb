It is typically used within functions, and are passed as arguments to higher order functions.While Lamda arguments can take any number of arguments, it should contain only one expression. On the other hand, the def functions require a function name and a body. The same function name must be then called in order to execute the function."

Lambda functions are also used to avoid typing lenghty lines of code, keeping it precise and concise."

Therefore, a predefined function and an iterable must be passed as arguments to the map function. The map() function returns a map object which is then used with built in functions like list() or set(), etc. to convert the map object to a list or a set.\n",
    "* Just like map() function,even in filter() function,we have to pass a predefined function and an iterable as arguments.The only difference is that if there is a condition used in the predefined function, then the filter function will only return those items of the iterable for which the Boolean values are True and it will filter out the rest. This filter() function is again used with built in functions like list, to get the output in a list form.\n",
    "* Here in the reduce() function, we again need to pass a function and an iterable. The reduce() function returns a single value as a result. When reduce() is used, the function is initially applied to the first and the second items of the iterable, and a result is obtained. Then the function is applied to the previous result and the third item of the iterable. This process keeps on repeating untill there are no more items left in the iterable. Finally, the reduce() function will produce a single value as an output."

    "* When a function is defined with a def statement and function name, and in the body of this function if the same function name is called, it is then known as a recursive function. It is basically calling the same function within the function. The recursive function should always have a condition, where when the condition is met, the recursion stops. Otherwise, once the function is called, it will keep executing infinitely. Recursive functions are generally used to keep the code clean and precise,without having to create new functions within the same function which perform the same operation. Also,Sequence creation is simpler through recursion than utilizing any nested iteration.  "
